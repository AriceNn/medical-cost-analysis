# medical-cost-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of an insurance dataset using Python and machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook explores the dataset, visualizes relationships between variables, preprocesses the data, and builds a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges. The analysis covers data visualization, feature encoding with OneHotEncoder, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and model evaluation with Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared score. The project showcases how to prepare, analyze, and optimize a machine learning model for predicting insurance charges based on various factors.
